# INVOICE EXTRACTOR

I have created a **Gen AI Invoice Extractor**, which allows users to upload invoices and extract specific information from them. The web part of the tool was built using **Streamlit** for a seamless and interactive user experience.

## Features:
- **Invoice Upload**: Upload your invoices directly to the tool.
- **Custom Extraction**: Specify what data you'd like to extract from the invoice. Whether it's the total amount, date, vendor name, or any other detail, the extractor can pull the information based on your input.
- **AI-powered**: The tool uses Generative AI to intelligently process and extract the requested data from the invoice.

## How it Works:
1. Upload your invoice in various formats (JPEG, JPG, PNG).
2. Enter the details you want to extract (e.g., "Total amount," "Vendor name").
3. The extractor will process the invoice and return the requested information.
